A few strong data points to consider adding:

**Tax Compliance Confidence:**
- IRS data shows ~40% of filers use professional tax prep services (H&R Block, tax attorneys, CPAs)
- Survey data: Only ~30% of Americans say they "fully understand" their tax obligations
- Gallup/AARP polls show majority of Americans find tax code "too complicated"

**Time Burden:**
- IRS estimates 7.1 billion hours annually on tax compliance (you cite this)
- That's roughly 21 hours per household per year
- Adds up to ~$213B in economic value lost to compliance alone

**Tax Gap:**
- IRS reports $600B+ annual "tax gap" (taxes owed but uncollected)
- Higher on capital gains and business income due to complexity
- Simplification directly improves collection rates

**Error Rates:**
- IRS audit data shows higher error rates on itemized deductions and complex credits
- EITC error rate ~24% (overpayment or underpayment)
- Simplification reduces these administrative errors

**Key Sources to Cite:**
- IRS Data Book (annual, public)
- Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances
- Brookings Institution reports on tax compliance
- Tax Foundation studies on compliance burden

I'd recommend adding a sentence or two around **line 3-4** of the press release noting: *"[X]% of Americans lack confidence in their tax filing, and the average household spends 21 hours annually on compliance."* This sets emotional stakes before launching into policy.
