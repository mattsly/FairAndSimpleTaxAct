# **Press Release**

**WASHINGTON, D.C. —** The U.S. tax code is broken: too complex, riddled with loopholes for the wealthy, and feeding an unsustainable deficit. Today, bipartisan leaders introduced the American Tax Fairness Act — phase one of comprehensive reform built on three principles: radical simplicity, fairness that fuels upward mobility, and fiscal durability.

### **Three principles, one system**

**Simplicity that restores transparency.** The code spans 2,600 pages of statute and 10,000 pages of regulations. This bill eliminates the AMT, streamlines brackets, and closes complex loopholes. Future phases would remove itemized deductions and enable pre-filled returns for most Americans.

**Fairness that fuels the climb.** Everyday savers and entrepreneurs get a \$1.5M lifetime capital gains exemption and simpler pass-through rules. Extreme wealth that exploits stepped-up basis, buy-borrow-die, and carried interest loopholes pays its share. The system rewards value creation, not tax engineering.

**Fiscal durability from Day 1.** The bill is revenue-positive, generating \$200–310B annually by closing loopholes and broadening the base. No gimmicks. This is the first step toward closing the gap between today’s 6% of GDP deficit and the sustainable 3–4% target, alongside future tax and spending reforms.

### **What supporters are saying**

'This bill closes loopholes that let billionaires avoid taxes while working families pay full freight. Earn a million, you pay tax. Inherit a billion? Under current law, zero. This ends that.'

— *Senior Democratic Senator*

'We eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax and pay for it by closing stepped-up basis. We protect family farms and businesses with 15-year payment flexibility. This is fiscal responsibility: real revenue from real loopholes.'

— *Senior Republican Senator*

'We’re getting $4,000 per kid, my filing is simpler, and billionaires finally pay their share. That’s real money for families like ours.'

— *Middle‑class parent, Ohio*

# **Tenets**

1. **Radical Simplicity**: If a rule cannot be automated or clearly explained to a normal taxpayer, it does not belong in the tax code.  
2. **Fuel the Climb**: The system should reward families building wealth and entrepreneurs creating companies — not financial engineering or dynastic wealth.  
3. **Fiscal Durability**: The reform is revenue-positive from Day 1 (\$200–310B annually), closing loopholes and broadening the base so the system collects what it is owed.

## **Q2: How much simpler is this really?**

**ATFA simplifies the code by replacing narrow carve-outs with universal rules.**

The current system’s complexity is a feature for those who can exploit it. ATFA targets the highest-value avoidance strategies:

* **Stepped-up basis at death** — The $300B+ loophole letting appreciated assets pass tax-free across generations
* **Buy-borrow-die** — Living off asset-backed loans to avoid ever selling (and ever paying tax)
* **Carried interest** — Reclassifying labor income as capital gains (closed structurally via 45% convergence)
* **QSBS carve-outs** — Sector-specific preferential treatment that creates distortions
* **Backdoor ROTH and mega-ROTH sheltering** — Workarounds that let billionaires shelter billions tax-free
* **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)** — A parallel tax system that adds complexity without solving the underlying problem
* **Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)** — Another layered system that complicates rather than clarifies

ATFA replaces this with clear, universal rules:

* Eight income brackets (adding 45% top bracket for $1.5M+ earners)
* One lifetime capital gains exemption ($1.5M per person)
* Death = realization event (no basis step-up)
* Progressive capital gains convergence at $100M+ (45%, matching ordinary income)

For typical filers, nothing changes structurally—you still file once a year with standard forms. But the system stops rewarding financial engineering and starts rewarding genuine value creation. Future phases can simplify filing further once the loopholes are closed.

---

## **Q3: Who benefits and who pays more?**

* **Working and middle-class families:** pay less  
* **Upper-middle-class families under \$400K:** protected from increases  
* **Extreme wealth:** pays more, through broader bases and higher top-end rates  
* **Everyone:** saves time and money on compliance

The pattern:
* Income tax brackets match current law (no change for most workers)
* Families with children benefit from the $4K/child credit  
* Capital gains below \$1.5M are tax-free (replaces the primary residence exclusion), progressive rates above that (15%/20%/27%/32%/45%)  
* Very large incomes ($1.5M+) and very large fortunes contribute more through the new 45% bracket

**In plain terms:**  
A nurse or teacher with kids saves money through the child benefit. A small business owner with capital gains under $1.5M pays nothing on those gains. A nine-figure fortune pays more.

---

## **Q4: How far does this go toward a responsible federal budget?**

The American Tax Fairness Act is **revenue-positive from Day 1**:

* Adding 45% top bracket for $1.5M+ earners: +$40-60B annually
* Closing stepped-up basis loophole (death = realization event): +$75-100B annually
* Closing buy-borrow-die and other avoidance strategies: +$25-50B annually
* Estate tax reform (lower exemption, broader base): +$50-65B annually
* Progressive capital gains rates above $1.5M exemption: +$50-80B annually
* QSBS elimination (universal $1.5M exemption instead): +$10-20B annually
* ROTH mega-account reforms (contribution freeze + death taxation of gains): +$15-25B annually
* **Total: $265-400B in new annual revenue**

These gains cover the costs ($50-70B for AMT/NIIT elimination and expanded child benefits), resulting in **$200-310B net annual revenue**.

This closes roughly 15-25% of the deficit gap. The remainder requires additional revenue measures and spending reforms; see [Appendix C: Path to Fiscal Sustainability](#appendix-c-path-to-fiscal-sustainability).

**Bottom line:** The Act is fiscally responsible and revenue-positive, but long-term balance requires parallel tax and spending discipline.

## **Part 2: Core Mechanics**

## **Q5: How do the new income tax brackets work?**

ATFA keeps income tax brackets close to current law, eliminates the AMT/NIIT, and adds a 45% top bracket for very high earners.

**Income tax bracket thresholds (indexed annually for inflation)**

| Filing Status | 10% | 12% | 22% | 24% | 32% | 35% | 37% | 45% |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Single | $0–$12K | $12K–$47K | $47K–$100K | $100K–$190K | $190K–$240K | $240K–$610K | $610K–$1.5M | $1.5M+ |
| Married filing jointly | $0–$24K | $24K–$94K | $94K–$200K | $200K–$380K | $380K–$490K | $490K–$730K | $730K–$3M | $3M+ |
| Head of household | $0–$17K | $17K–$63K | $63K–$160K | $160K–$290K | $290K–$365K | $365K–$670K | $670K–$2.25M | $2.25M+ |

**Key changes:**
- AMT and NIIT eliminated
- 45% top bracket added ($1.5M+ Single / $3M+ MFJ)
- Standard brackets through 37% remain essentially unchanged

Phase 1 keeps brackets stable while closing loopholes; broader bracket consolidation can follow alongside payroll tax reform.

## **Q6: How are capital gains, dividends, and investment income taxed?**

ATFA sets capital gains rates by lifetime cumulative gains to reward early saving and ensure extreme wealth does not pay lower rates than labor. **At $100M+ in lifetime gains, capital gains rates converge with ordinary income (45%).**

### **Capital Gains (Asset Appreciation)**

| Cumulative Lifetime Gains |  Marginal Capital Gains Rate |
| ----- | ----- |
| \$0 – \$1.5M | **0%** |
| \$1.5M – \$3M | **15%** |
| \$3M – \$10M | **20%** |
| \$10M – \$50M | **27%** |
| \$50M – \$100M | **32%** |
| \$100M+ | **45%** |

Key rules:

* Assets must be held **more than one year** to qualify  
* Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income  
* The exemption is **\$1.5M per person** (married couples can combine for **\$3M**)  
* The exemption applies across all assets — once used, it is gone  
* Lifetime gains tracking starts at enactment; only post-enactment gains count

This structure protects ordinary wealth-building while ensuring very large gains contribute more.

### **Capital Losses**

* Capital losses offset capital gains without limit (same as current law)
* Up to $3,000/year can offset ordinary income (same as current law)
* Unused losses carry forward indefinitely (same as current law)

### **Dividends (Investment Yield)**

* **Qualified dividends** — Taxed at capital gains rates based on the filer's cumulative lifetime gains (not the $1.5M exemption)
* **Ordinary dividends** — Taxed as ordinary income (same as current law)
* Dividends do NOT count toward the $1.5M lifetime exemption — the exemption is reserved for capital appreciation only

### **Interest Income & Foreign Investments**

* Municipal bond interest — Tax-exempt (unchanged)
* All other interest — Taxed as ordinary income (unchanged)
* Foreign dividends — Taxed under same rules as domestic dividends with foreign tax credit (unchanged)

---

## **Q7: What is the Child Tax Credit under this plan, and how is it different from today?**

The Act replaces the CTC, EITC, and childcare credit with one universal benefit.

### **Universal \$4,000 per Child**

* **\$4,000 per child per year** (full benefit under \$120K)
* **Linear phase-out** — reduces from \$120K–\$400K, reaches \$0 at \$400K+
* **Fully refundable** — no itemization, receipts, or childcare verification

**Phase-out formula:**
- Income ≤ \$120K: Full \$4K per child
- \$120K < Income < \$400K: (Kids × \$4K) × [1 − (Income − \$120K) / \$280K]
- Income ≥ \$400K: \$0

**Cost:** New system ~\$220B annually vs. current ~\$276B (CTC + EITC + childcare) → net savings ~\$56B.

This removes benefit cliffs, treats stay-at-home and working parents equally, and makes support predictable. Distributional impacts are detailed in [Appendix B](#appendix-b-taxpayer-case-studies).

# Part 3: Closing Loopholes

---

## **Q8: What are the ROTH account reforms, and why close the "Peter Thiel loophole"?**

The Act makes four changes to ROTH IRAs that expand access while closing mega-account abuse:

1. **Remove income limits** for direct ROTH contributions (ends backdoor conversions).
2. **Raise the annual cap** to \$15K (indexed).
3. **Freeze new contributions** once the balance reaches \$2.5M; investment growth can continue.
4. **Tax ROTH gains at death** as capital gains using the remaining lifetime exemption; contributions remain untaxed, with a 15-year payment option for illiquid estates.

These reforms close the "Peter Thiel" mega-ROTH loophole while protecting ordinary savers. **Revenue: \$15–25B annually.**

## **Q9: How does the Act close the 'buy, borrow, die' loophole?**

Buy-borrow-die lets ultra-wealthy households borrow against appreciated assets, live on loans, and erase gains at death via stepped-up basis. ATFA closes the loop with a deemed-sale rule for asset-backed borrowing and by ending stepped-up basis.

**New rule (asset-backed borrowing):**
* If a loan is secured by appreciated assets and the loan exceeds cost basis, the excess triggers taxable gain  
* Tax applies to appreciation only; basis steps up by the borrowed amount to avoid double taxation  
* Illiquid assets get payment flexibility (same 15-year option)

**What is not affected:** ordinary business loans, mortgages, and borrowing for reinvestment or expansion. The rule targets personal-consumption borrowing against appreciated collateral, using lender-reported loan purpose and existing enforcement doctrines.

**Bottom line:** You can still borrow, but you cannot live tax-free on appreciation and wipe the gain at death.

## **Q10: What happens when someone dies?**

Under the Fair & Simple Tax Act, death is treated as a realization event — unrealized capital gains are taxed on the final return using the same lifetime capital gains system, and heirs receive a clean basis at the value at death.

**How the exemption applies:**
* Remaining lifetime exemption shields unrealized gains first  
* Gains above that are taxed at the progressive capital gains rates (15%/20%/27%/32%/45%)

**Example (typical estate):** \$400K in unrealized gains with an unused \$1.5M exemption → **\$0** tax.

**Illiquid assets:** 15-year payment option at low interest to avoid forced sales of farms, businesses, or real estate.

**Bottom line:** Most families owe nothing; large fortunes pay deferred tax and heirs start with a clean basis.

## **Q11: How does this close estate planning loopholes like GRATs, dynasty trusts, and valuation discounts?**

The Act eliminates the underlying conditions that make these techniques work — without banning each vehicle. GRATs, dynasty trusts, valuation discounts, and similar tools rely on indefinite deferral, stepped-up basis at death, and high estate exemptions.

**ATFA changes the foundation:**
* Death is a realization event; no stepped-up basis  
* Estate exemption lowered to \$5M per person (\$10M couples)  
* Progressive lifetime gains rates apply to large estates  
* Trust income is taxed annually at the top rate; no exemption stacking  
* 15-year payment option protects illiquid family businesses and farms

**Bottom line:** Trusts and planning tools can still be used for governance and protection, but appreciation cannot escape taxation indefinitely.

## **Q12: How do trusts work under this plan? Can I use them to avoid paying tax forever?**

**No.** Trusts can still be used for estate planning and protection, but they cannot be used for permanent tax deferral.

**How trusts are taxed:**
* **Retained income/gains:** Trust pays **45%** in the year earned  
* **Distributions:** Beneficiaries pay ordinary income tax or capital gains tax using their lifetime exemption  
* **Exemption is per person:** Trusts do not get their own \$1.5M exemption and cannot stack exemptions across generations

Trusts remain useful for governance, creditor protection, and controlled distributions — not for avoiding tax forever.


# Part 4: Impact on Innovation & Investment


## **Q13: Doesn’t eliminating the primary residence exclusion hurt homeowners?**

**No.** The \$1.5M lifetime capital gains exemption covers most home-sale gains and treats housing the same as other long-term saving.

**Example:** Buy at \$250K, sell at \$650K → \$400K gain, **\$0 tax**. You still have \$1.1M of exemption left for future gains.

The exemption is designed to cover multiple moves over a lifetime; most households never reach \$1.5M in total housing gains.

**Why replace the current exclusion?** The current rule privileges homeowners, encourages tax-driven housing decisions, and requires ownership/use tests. A single lifetime exemption is simpler and neutral across homes, stocks, and businesses.

**Bottom line:** Most home sales remain tax-free, with fewer special rules and fairer treatment across asset types.

## **Q14: Why no special carried interest rule?**

Because the structure already closes it. At \$100M+ in lifetime capital gains, the rate converges to 45% — the same as the top ordinary income rate — so re-labeling labor income as capital gains no longer helps.

**Why this works:**
* Applies automatically across private equity, hedge funds, venture, and real estate  
* No bespoke rules or carve-outs; IRS applies the lifetime gains schedule  
* Limited partners are unchanged; this targets managers’ profit share

**Example:** \$200M in lifetime carry → gains above \$100M taxed at 45%, yielding an effective rate in the low 40s%.

**Bottom line:** Carried interest is closed by design, not by creating a new carve-out.

## **Q15: Will this punish entrepreneurs and innovators?**

**No.** ATFA keeps long-term capital gains treatment, adds a \$1.5M lifetime exemption, and taxes short-term trading as ordinary income. It replaces QSBS with a **universal exemption** that applies to all founders, regardless of entity type or industry.

Some large exits that currently qualify for QSBS will pay more, but the system is broader, simpler, and more predictable. Case studies are in [Appendix B](#appendix-b-taxpayer-case-studies).

**Bottom line:** The Act rewards patient capital and innovation while eliminating narrow carve-outs that only some founders can access.


## **Q16: What about expatriation and capital flight?**

**Renouncing citizenship triggers the same rule as death: a mark-to-market tax on all gains, with the lifetime exemption and progressive capital gains rates.**

### **How the exit tax works**
- All appreciated assets are marked to market on the departure date; remaining lifetime exemption applies first.
- Gains above the exemption are taxed at 15%/20%/27%/32% based on total lifetime gains.
- Illiquid assets get 15-year payment flexibility to avoid forced sales.
- Covered expatriate rules continue to apply; returns within 10 years can trigger collection.

### **Enforcement and leakage controls**
- Uses existing reporting (FATCA/FBAR), beneficial ownership rules, and bank reporting on large transfers.
- Departure bonds and treaty information-sharing can be required for high-net-worth departures.
- Proceeds are hard to hide if they are ever moved into the formal financial system or used in developed markets.

### **Scale of the risk**
- A few thousand people renounce annually; only a minority are tax-motivated and fewer still can successfully hide proceeds long term.
- Even with some evasion, the leakage is small relative to the revenue recovered from closing other loopholes.

**Bottom line:** Departure is taxed as if assets were sold. Payment relief prevents fire sales, existing reporting makes evasion difficult, and the fiscal risk is limited.

| **90-95%** | \$300,000 | 23.5% | 24.2% | +0.7% | **+\$2,100** | Pays more |
| **95-99%** | \$500,000 | 26.2% | 28.5% | +2.3% | **+\$11,500** | Pays more |
| **Top 1% (99-99.9%)** | \$1.5M | 28.5% | 32.8% | +4.3% | **+\$64,500** | Pays significantly more |
| **Top 0.1%** | \$5M | 29.8% | 35.2% | +5.4% | **+\$270,000** | Pays significantly more |
| **Top 0.01%** | \$25M | 23.1% | 37.5% | +14.4% | **+\$3.6M** | Pays dramatically more |

*Note: Current effective rates include FICA, federal income tax, and account for common deductions/loopholes. Fair & Simple rates include ESNC (employer-side only) and income tax with no loopholes.*

**Key takeaways:**
- Bottom 80% pay less or about the same, driven primarily by the $4K/child benefit.
- Upper-middle incomes are mostly flat; top earners pay more via the 45% bracket and loophole closures.
- The top 0.01% sees the largest increase, which funds most of the net revenue.

**Bottom line:** ATFA improves fairness and fiscal durability while simplifying compliance.

Current law: step-up and a \$14M exemption would likely result in **\$0 tax** for a similarly sized estate.


## **Appendix C: Path to Fiscal Sustainability**

ATFA is a strong start, but it addresses only the revenue side. A durable path requires spending reform and growth, aligned with the three tenets.

### **Fiscal Gap (Illustrative)**

| Metric | Current | Sustainable Target | Gap to Close |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Federal Deficit** | ~\$1.7T (~6% of GDP) | ~\$840B-1.12T (3-4% of GDP) | ~\$580-860B annually |
| **Over 10 Years** | ~\$17T of deficit | ~\$8.4T-11.2T sustainable | Need to reduce by ~$5.8T-8.6T |

ATFA closes $200-310B annually (~15-25% of the gap). Remaining gap: roughly $230-720B per year.

### **Three-Track Strategy**

**Track 1: Revenue (ATFA)**
- $200-310B annually from loophole closure and base broadening.

**Track 2: Spending Reform (Partner Legislation)**
Target $230-720B annually using the same tenets: simplicity, fairness, durability.

| Category | Potential Annual Savings | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Entitlement targeting and fraud reduction | \$150-300B | Focused on high-income beneficiaries |
| Program consolidation | \$80-150B | Reduce duplication across agencies |
| Defense procurement and IT modernization | \$60-120B | Efficiency gains, not capability cuts |
| Interest savings (deficit reduction) | \$100-300B | Compounding over time |
| **Total Potential Annual Savings** | **\$390-870B** | Range varies by design |

**Track 3: Growth**
- With 2-3% nominal growth, the deficit falls as a share of GDP even with flat dollar deficits.

### **Phasing**

- **Phase 1 (Years 1-3):** ATFA enacted; revenue positive from Day 1.
- **Phase 2 (Years 2-5):** spending reform and simplification implementation (pre-filled returns, automated matching).
- **Phase 3 (Years 5-10):** optional refinements (retirement account simplification, Social Security sustainability) if the gap persists.

**Bottom line:** Revenue reform + spending reform + growth deliver a credible path to a 3-4% deficit without middle-class tax hikes or across-the-board cuts.
